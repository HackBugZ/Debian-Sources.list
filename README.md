Debian 12 APT Sources List – For Learning, Testing, and Development

This is a complete and categorized APT sources list for a Debian-12-based test system.
It includes all official Debian repositories from Debian servers only.

Each repository entry is split into a single line for easy enabling/disabling via comments.

The goal is to provide a full setup for learning, testing, and experimenting with Debian 12 packages.

Includes:

    **main** – Free and open-source software officially supported by Debian

    **contrib** – Free software that depends on non-free packages

    **non-free** – Non-free software (e.g. with restrictive licenses)

    **non-free-firmware** – Firmware that is not freely licensed

    **updates** – Important updates between point releases

    **security** – Security updates from the Debian security team

    **proposed-updates** – Candidate packages for the next point release

    **backports** – Newer packages ported from testing

    **deb-src** – Source packages (optional, for building or patching)

Feel free to adapt the list to your needs.
