Debian 12 APT Sources List – For Learning, Testing, and Development

This is a complete and categorized APT sources list for a Debian-12-based test system.
It includes all official Debian repositories from Debian servers only.

Each repository entry is split into a single line for easy enabling/disabling via comments.

The goal is to provide a full setup for learning, testing, and experimenting with Debian 12 packages.

Includes:

    main – Free and open-source software officially supported by Debian

    contrib – Free software that depends on non-free packages

    non-free – Non-free software (e.g. with restrictive licenses)

    non-free-firmware – Firmware that is not freely licensed

    updates – Important updates between point releases

    security – Security updates from the Debian security team

    proposed-updates – Candidate packages for the next point release

    backports – Newer packages ported from testing

    deb-src – Source packages (optional, for building or patching)

Feel free to adapt the list to your needs.
